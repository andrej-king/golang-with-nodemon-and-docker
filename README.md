# Go + Nodemon + Docker

**Background**

Hey. \
When developing a Go application with docker, after making the changes, the docker container must be repackaged to see
them. \
Using the Nodemon npm package, the application is reloaded as soon as the changes are saved in the file.

# Start ðŸš€

* `make init` run docker container with app.
* `make down` stop docker containers.

## Open in browser ðŸŒŽ
